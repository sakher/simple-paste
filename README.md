This application is powered by two fantastic open-source libraries:

-   [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown): A robust HTML to Markdown converter written in JavaScript. It takes your HTML content and transforms it into Markdown, preserving the structure and format of the original content.
-   [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown): A JavaScript library that converts Markdown into HTML. It allows us to take the Markdown generated by Turndown and convert it back into HTML, preserving the formatting and structure of the original content.

This simple client-side application was inspired by [Paste to Markdown](https://euangoddard.github.io/clipboard2markdown/), a handy tool that converts clipboard content into Markdown. We've expanded on this idea to include conversion back to HTML and additional features for inspecting and manipulating clipboard content.

**Note:** All conversions happen in your browser, and no data is sent to the server.
